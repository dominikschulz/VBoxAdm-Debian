=head1 NAME

autodiscover.pl - Auto(configuration|discovery) support for VBoxAdm

=head1 VERSION

This documentation refers to autodiscover.pl version @VERSION@
built on @BUILDDATE@.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script supports Autoconfiguration for Thunderbird, Outlook, Evolution and KMail.

=head2 THUNDERBIRD

The Thunderbird Autoconfiguration was proposed some time ago is available since, at least, version 3.x.

See https://wiki.mozilla.org/Thunderbird:Autoconfiguration for more details.

The process is rather simple. When a new account is created TB tries several ways to find out the correct
crendentials w/o asking the user too much. The user just has to enter his email address and password and
TB tries to do the rest.

Among other things it will try to GET http://autoconfig.domain.tld/mail/config-v1.1.xml?emailaddress=user@domain.tld.

If it receives a well formed XML response which contains the desired data this information will be used.

TB expects to find at least an SMTP section and one of POP3 and IMAP.

=head2 OUTLOOK

Microsoft introduced Outlook Autodiscover with Outlook 2007, acording to TechNet.

See http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc511507.aspx for more details.

The implementation, however, is ... well ... different.

It looks like MS made the same engineers that created UPnP implement this Autodiscover.

Among other things Outlook will try to contact https://autodiscover.domain.tld/autodiscover/autodiscover.xml.
One could have used a simple GET Request here, like Mozilla did, but no. This is Microsoft. They do it ... different.

They send a POST Request containing XML data, only for transmitting an email address.

Naive minds would think that you'd respond with a HTTP 200 OK status code, but hey, we can do better.

Microsoft requests a custom HTTP 405 Error for a successfull (!) request. This response ought to contain a
longish XML response.

=head2 APPLE MAIL

While Microsoft at least publishes their Documentation Apple doesn't seem to do. There are rumors that Apple
Mail does support Autoconfiguration, but I wasn't able to find any details on this. If you can provide
this information let me know.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

CGI, Template::Toolkit, Sys::Syslog and Config::Std.
