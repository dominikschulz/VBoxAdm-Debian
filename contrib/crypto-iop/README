API Prototpyes

The roundcube plugin should have no "business logic" by itself. It will only dispatch requests to the HTTP API.

Requests will be encrypted, each request will consist of:
- u=username (email addy)
- p=payload (encrypted request, users password - zero-padded/cut to 56 chars - is used as the key),
iv is hardcoded
