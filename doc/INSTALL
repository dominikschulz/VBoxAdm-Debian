How to Install VBoxAdm
======================

* Prerequisites
- MySQLd
- Lighttpd (or Apache)
- PHP5
- Perl
- Perltidy
- Perl DBI
- DBD MySQL
- Config::Std
- Locale::Maketext
- Crypt::GeneratePassword
- Data::Password

- Postfix 2.6+

Debian based (Debian, Ubuntu):
  aptitude install perl perltidy libdbi-perl libdbd-mysql-perl libconfig-std-perl libtest-pod-perl libmail-sender-perl libcgi-application-perl libcgi-application-basic-plugin-bundle-perl libcgi-application-extra-plugin-bundle-perl famfamfam-silk-png libmime-encwords-perl libhtml-clean-perl libtemplate-perl lighttpd mysql-server php5-cgi postfix dovecot-imapd libcrypt-generatepassword-perl libdata-password-perl

Red Hat based (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora):
  yum install perl perltidy perl-DBI (and others)

Other Distributions:
Users of other distributions will have to figure out themself what packages they need to install. If you use a distribution not listed here and have figured out which packages to install tell me and I'll and the information to this file.

In case some of the perl dependencies are not packaged for your distribution you can install additional packages with the CPAN shell. Just run
  perl -MCPAN -eshell
and then use install <Package> like this
  $> install Config::Std
to install the missing CPAN packages.

A note on the Silk icon set: At the time of this writing there is no official debian package of this icon set. Grab it from the vboxadm Download page. Users of other distributions can just grab the icon set from the famfamfam homepage and unpack it to /usr/share/icons/famfamfam/silk.

* Create required system users
------------------------------
This application recommends a number of system users to be created. All services could be runder
under the same user, but for security reasons I very strongly recommend you to create the following users.

Postfix will need its own users, usually called postfix. The debian package will create this users for you along
with setting up postfix.

Dovecot should have its own user, too. The debian package will create this user, too.

The SMTP-Proxy and the vacation script should be as the user vboxadm. Create this user now:

  $> adduser --system --home /var/lib/vboxadm --no-create-home --group --disabled-password --disabled-login vboxadm
  
I prefer to create an extra user just to hold the mails. Create the directory containing your maildirs and this user now:

  $> mkdir -p /srv/vmail/
  $> adduser --system --home /srv/vmail --no-create-home --group --disabled-password --disabled-login vmail
  $> chown -R vmail:vmail /srv/vmail/

* Install MySQL
---------------
In the default setup we need InnoDB. If you want to avoid InnoDB you can change the schema,
but beware: This application relies on working foreign key contraints. So embrace errors if you
skip InnoDB.

* Create the Databases
----------------------
$> mysql -uroot -p<MYSQL-ROOT-PW>
mysql> CREATE DATABASE vboxadm;
mysql> CREATE DATABASE roundcube;

* Load Schema
-------------
$> mysql -uroot -p vboxadm < doc/mysql/schema.sql

* Create Database Accounts
--------------------------
- vboxadm
mysql> GRANT ALL ON vboxadm.* TO 'vboxadm'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
- postfix
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON vboxadm.* TO 'postfix'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
- dovecot
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON vboxadm.mailboxes TO 'dovecot'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON vboxadm.domains TO 'dovecot'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
- roundcube
mysql> GRANT ALL ON roundcube.* TO 'roundcube'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
- vboxadm_user (for vacation and pw change)
mysql> GRANT SELECT,UPDATE ON vboxadm.mailboxes TO 'vboxadm_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
mysql> GRANT SELECT ON vboxadm.domains TO 'vboxadm_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '<PASSWORD>';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

Leave the mysql client and connect as each of the newly created users to see if they are working:
$> mysql -uvboxadm -p<PASSWORD> vboxadm -e 'SHOW TABLES'
$> mysql -upostfix -p<PASSWORD> vboxadm -e 'SHOW TABLES'
$> mysql -udovecot -p<PASSWORD> vboxadm -e 'SHOW TABLES'
$> mysql -uroundcube -p<PASSWORD> roundcube -e 'SHOW TABLES'
$> mysql -uvboxadm_user -p<PASSWORD> vboxadm -e 'SHOW TABLES'

* Install Lighttpd
------------------
Enable cgi (or fastcgi) and symlink the lighttpd/12-vboxadm.conf to /etc/lighttpd/conf-enabled/12-vboxadm.conf.
Restart lighttpd.

* Configure Postfix
-------------------
Copy all files and subdirs of doc/postfix to /etc/postfix.

Debian: The files mentioned are located at /usr/share/doc/vboxadm-common/examples/postfix!
You need to gunzip the files master.cf.gz and main.cf.gz.

Go to /etc/postfix/maps/. Edit each virtual_*.cf file and enter the password
you've choosen for the MySQL user postfix.

Change to /etc/postfix and create the database maps:
$> make maps

* Configure Dovecot
-------------------
Copy all files of doc/dovecot to /etc/dovecot.

Debian: The files mentioned are located at /usr/share/doc/vboxadm-common/examples/dovecot!

Open the file /etc/dovecot/dovecot-sql.conf and change the password in the connect line.

Adjust the uid and gid in the file /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf to the ones of the user vmail. Set first_valid_uid and first_valid_gid
to the uid and gid of the user vmail.

* Install VBoxAdm
-----------------
To build and install this application use the supplied Makefile:
	make clean
	make all
	make install

You may set DESTDIR when running make install to specify another prefix
than the default one in /usr. Just run the make install command like this:
	DESTDIR=/your/prefix/ make install

Debian: You should have already installed the debian packages.

* Configure Database for VBoxAdm
--------------------------------
All parts of VBoxAdm access the central configuration file at /etc/vboxadm/vboxadm.conf.
This is an ini-style configuration file. The default section applies to all parts of this application
and each component can have its own section. In the default section you should configure
the database to use the mysql user vboxadm create above.

Insert these lines below [default]:
dbuser=vboxadm
dbpass=<PASSWORD>
dbdb=vboxadm
dbhost=localhost

* Configure Vacation
--------------------
The vacation script is called from within Postfix's master.cf.
If you've created the system user for it as recommended above you should be ready to go.

* Configure SMTP-Proxy
----------------------
At the time of this writing there is no init script for the SMTP-Proxy so you need to create one.
The SMTP-Proxy has a number of options that can be configure in the vboxadm.conf.

Debian: The debian package provides an init script.

We'll discuss each one. You should adjust them to your needs.

The SMTP-Proxy is a preforking SMTP-Server. The prefork mechanism is similar to the one of the
popular apache http server. You can define a minimum number of server processes which will
wait for incoming connections by the upfront postfix.

The following options must be placed in the section labeled [smtpproxy].

Variable: listen, Default Value: localhost:10024, Description: Specifies on which host/port the proxy will listen
for incoming SMTP connections.
Variable: connect, Default Value: localhost:10025, Description: Specifies to which host/port the proxy will
connect and forward its SMTP connections to.
Variable: pidfile, Default Value: /var/run/vboxadm-smtpproxy.pid, Description: The pidfile.
Variable: user, Default Value: vboxadm, Description: Run as this user
Variable: group, Default Value: vboxadm, Description: Run as this group
Variable: max_msg_size, Default Value: 25, Description: The maximum allowed message size.
Variable: sa_max_msg_size, Default Value: 16, Description: The maximum message size (in MB) for SpamAssassin scanning.
Variable: sa_timeout, Default Value: 30, Description: The maximum allow scan time for SpamAssassin.
Variable: min_servers, Default Value: 20, Description: Start at least this many servers
Variable: max_servers, Default Value: 120, Description: Run no more than this servers
Variable: min_spare_servers, Default Value: 10, Description: Have at least this many idle servers available
Variable: max_spare_servers, Default Value: 20, Description: Have no more than this idle servers around
Variable: max_requests, Default Value: 250, Description: Each fork should process this many requests and than exit
Variable: nsloglevel, Default Value: 2, Description: Verbosity.
Variable: logsock, Default Value: unix, Description: Syslog Logsock.

* Create your Siteadmin
-----------------------
Use the script contrib/mkadmin.pl to create a new siteadmin.

$> contrib/mkadmin.pl --username your.name@domain.tld

Use the supplied information to log in to VBoxAdm and create your
users and mailboxes.

* Install Roundcube
-------------------
Unpack Roundcube to /opt/roundcube, create a symlink from /opt/roundcube/roundcube-0.x.y/
/opt/roundcube/current.

To satisfy the requirements you'll need to install a few aditional packages:

(Debian) $> aptitude install php5-cgi php5-mysql php5-mcrypt php5-imap php5-intl

On Debian system you have to modify the suhosin settings. Edit the file /etc/php5/conf.d/suhosin.in
and change the value suhosin.session.encrypt to off. Make sure the line is no longer commented.

The use the installer access http://roundcube.domain.tld/installer/ and follow the instructions of the installer. Use the database
and user created above. You should select Mysqli for database access. If you install all components on one
server you can enter localhost and IMAP and SMTP server, if not you probably know what you are doing.

When the installer has created the config for you place them in /opt/roundcube/config/main.inc.php and db.inc.php
and symlink from /opt/roundcube/config/{db,main}.inc.php to /opt/roundcube/current/config/. 

The final step of the installation is to remove the installer directory.

* Install Roundcube Plugin: vacation
------------------------------------
Since the vacation plugin is not contained in the upstream sources of roundcube, a modified version is supplied
with VBoxAdm. Copy the folder contrib/roundcube/plugins/vacation to your roundcube plugins folder.

Debian: Extract the file /usr/share/doc/vboxadm-common/examples/roundcube-plugin-vacation.tar.gz
to /opt/roundcube/current/plugins.

* Configure Roundcube Plugins
-----------------------------
Edit plugins/vacation/config.ini and set a dsn in the default section:
dsn = "mysql://vboxadm_user:password@localhost"

Copy the config.inc.php.dist in plugins/password to config.inc.php and set the dsn
$rcmail_config['password_db_dsn'] = 'mysql://vboxadm_user:password@localhost/vboxadm';

and the password query:
$rcmail_config['password_query'] = "UPDATE vboxadm.mailboxes SET password = %p WHERE local_part = %l AND password = %o AND domain_id = (SELECT id FROM vboxadm.domains WHERE name = %d)";

Copy the config.inc.php.dist in plugins/managesieve to config.inc.php.

* Active the Roundcube Plugins
------------------------------
Edit the file config/main.inc.php and add the plugins 'password', 'managesieve' and 'vacation'.

$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('password','managesieve', 'vacation');
