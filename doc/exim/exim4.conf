# It was originally generated by `eximconfig', part of the exim package
# distributed with Debian, but it may edited by the mail system administrator.
# This file originally generated by eximconfig at Sun Jan 19 15:46:24 CET 2003
# See exim info section for details of the things that can be configured here.

# Please see the manual for a complete list

# This file is divided into several parts, all but the last of which are
# terminated by a line containing the word "end". The parts must appear
# in the correct order, and all must be present (even if some of them are
# in fact empty). Blank lines, and lines starting with # are ignored.
