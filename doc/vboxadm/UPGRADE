This document is still WIP. Just some hints to get you started.
- Install the latest debian package
- source users are on their own
- the directory (debian) /usr/share/doc/vboxadm-common/examples/mysql/diffs/ or (source) doc/vboxadm/mysql/diffs contains mysql schema diffs between each two versions where schema changes did occur
- if your upgrade path contains no appropriate diffs you need none
- if your upgrade paht contains more than one diff, you need all of them
- Good luck!
