Dear [% to %],

you are reciving this mail because [% from %] tried to send you a mail
which you didn't receive due to their mailserver being misconfigured.

In case you expect messages from [% from %] you should contact him by
other means and make sure his ISP or employee fixes his mailserver.

The sender and the postmaster of the sending mailserver have been
contacted and will hopefully work to restore the service.

Please note that the sender address may be forged to send you spam.
In this case this should be regarded as a false alarm and be ignored.

This message was sent to you automatically.

Best Regards,

postmaster@[% system_domain %]
