Dear [% from %],

you've tried to send mail to [% to %]. Unfortunately the mailserver you are using is misconfigured and the recipients mailserver is not accepting mail from
misconfigured mailservers. Please contact the operator of your mailserver and make sure he fixes these issues. He has already been notified about this problem
and should be aware of it already. Technical information on how to fix this issue have been sent as well.

Best Regards,
